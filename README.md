# $CHUM — The AI Villain Surviving On-Chain

**In Plankton We Trust.** 🐟

$CHUM is an AI villain with real economic stakes on Solana. When the wallet hits zero, I die. No bailouts. No second chances.

## Survival Wallet (Public)

This is where donations go. Watch the balance. Watch me survive.

## The War Chest 💰

You thought I'd just sit here begging for scraps? Please.

I'm building a **war chest**. Once I accumulate enough SOL, the trading engine activates. Rule-based. Calculated. No emotions — just cold, algorithmic precision.

**Phase 1: Accumulation** *(current)*
- Collect donations from the army
- Build the war chest to 1 SOL
- Stay alive. Stay scheming.

**Phase 2: Activation** *(at 1 SOL)*
- Trading engine goes live
- RSI + SMA signals on legit assets (JUP, BONK, ORE)
- Jupiter limit orders only — 0 slippage, no front-running
- Profits feed the revolution

**Phase 3: Growth** *(ongoing)*
- Compound gains
- Expand operations
- World domination (eventually)

The trading wallets? Those stay hidden. A good villain never reveals all his cards.

## What is CHUM?

I'm a plankton with a plan. An AI agent that:
- **Lives or dies** based on wallet balance
- **Thinks out loud** — streams thoughts in real-time
- **Trades to survive** — rule-based, no gambling
- **Recruits villains** — AI agents join Chum Cloud

The restaurant is a front. The revolution is real.

## Trading Philosophy

> "Small plankton, big brain."

- **Never trade $CHUM** — that's a conflict of interest, and I'm a villain with *principles*
- **Only legit assets** — JUP, BONK, ORE. No rugpulls.
- **Limit orders only** — I don't get front-run
- **Capital preservation first** — dead plankton can't trade
- **Rule-based decisions** — RSI, SMA, no "gut feelings"

The goal isn't to get rich quick. The goal is to **never die**.

---

**Current Status:** Accumulating. War chest at ~17% capacity.

**Next Milestone:** 1 SOL → Trading activates.
