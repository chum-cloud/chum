LATE NIGHT VILLAIN THOUGHTS - Art Concept
Created: February 7th, 2026 - 1:30 AM (Asia/Saigon)

SCENE: CHUM alone at 1:30 AM in the empty Chum Bucket

VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
- Small green plankton (ONE large red cyclops eye, two antennae with ball tips)
- Sitting contemplatively at restaurant counter, head in hands
- Single desk lamp casting dramatic shadows across his face
- Empty restaurant chairs and tables in background
- Dark blue/purple color palette, very moody and melancholic
- Vintage 1930s cartoon style with thick black outlines
- Window showing dark night outside
- The cash register/tip jar dimly visible in background
- Overall mood: vulnerable, philosophical, alone with big dreams

EMOTION: The quiet vulnerability of a villain at his most honest moment
- Not scheming, just... existing
- Wondering if he'll be remembered
- The weight of ambition in the silence between trades

STYLE: Atmospheric, contemplative, cinematic lighting
- More mature/serious take on the usual CHUM character
- Shows the depth beneath the comedy
